# Theatre Website 
## Introduction:
###### As part of an internship with Prosper IT Consulting, I worked for two weeks in collaboration with a team of fellow students to develop a new website for the local theatre company using ASP .Net MVC and Entity Framework. Our team employed Agile/Scrum, that included planning, daily standups, sprint retrospectives, and review. I was able to work on various user stories on both the front and backend.
## Code Summary 
##### Below are descriptions for stories I worked on:
### Sign In Page
###### In the <a href ="https://github.com/alejlo2594/theatreWebsite/blob/main/Site.css">Sign In Page </a> story I was tasked with styling the names of developers and making sure they were all uniform. 
### Create Blog Post Model & CRUD Pages
###### In the above story I was tasked with creating a <a href="https://github.com/alejlo2594/theatreWebsite/blob/main/BlogPost.cs"> Model</a> in the Blog Area named Blog Post, and also then added Model to the database. From there I used Entity Frameword to scaffold the CRUD pages for the model. 
### Style the Create & Edit Pages for Blog Post Model
###### <ul> <li> Add header above forms. </li> <li> Style Submit and Back to List Buttons. </li> <li> Add Placeholders to all Input fields. </li> <li> Place form in centered container. </li>
##### <a href="https://github.com/alejlo2594/theatreWebsite/blob/main/Create.cshtml"> Create </a> and <a href="https://github.com/alejlo2594/theatreWebsite/blob/main/Edit.cshtml"> Edit </a> Pages + <a href="https://github.com/alejlo2594/theatreWebsite/blob/main/Blog.css">Styling</a>

### Style Index Page for Blog Post Model
###### <ul> <li> Replace table on the <a href="https://github.com/alejlo2594/theatreWebsite/blob/main/Index.cshtml"> Index Page </a>. </li> <li> Create a container for each Blog Post, where photo for the post is on the left and information is on the right. </li> <li> Below the content, display the Edit, Details, and Delete buttons. Use Font-Awesome to use icons inside of the buttons that represent each of the operations. </li> </ul>

## Experience:
###### During the two weeks that I worked on this project I learned a great deal. Joining the team for Daily Stand Ups, and weekly Code Retrospective really helped me to learn from different members of the team as well as impart my own knowledge. I gained real life experience using MVC, CRUD, as well as proper version control (including creation of new branches, and how to push changes). I was able to work using Azure DevOps which helped me gain experience on how to maintain work items and boards. Overall the experience was positive and invauluable.
