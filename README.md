# Theatre Website 
## Introduction:
###### As part of an internship with Prosper IT Consulting, I worked for two weeks in collaboration with a team of fellow students to develop a new website for the local theatre company using ASP .Net MVC and Entity Framework. Our team employed Agile/Scrum, that included planning, daily standups, sprint retrospectives, and review. I was able to work on various user stories on both the front and backend.
